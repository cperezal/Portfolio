# Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University. Throughout the six weeks of the course, I will post several data visualizations that I will create for class assignments. Likewise, I will walk through the process of creating my final project. 

# About me 
I am a student of the Entertainment Industry Management Masters (MEIM) at Heinz College. I am from Argentina and moved to Pittsburgh in August. As my program suggests, I am interested in working in entertainment, more specifically the sports industry.

# What I hope to learn
As someone with a bachellors degree in communications, I understand the importance of it and how it can shape the way we see the world and live our daily lives. Data visualization is a key part of that. In this course I look forward to learn new tools to create visualizations and gain knowledge on how to use these tools and dataviz theory to convey a story.

# My Class Portfolio
I will be posting my data visualizations throughout the course on this page and tracking my progress. By looking at the assignment pages, you will be able to walk through my process and understand what each assignemnt entailed.

## [OECD Dataviz](/dataviz2.md)
For this assignment, I took a look at data from the OECD and designed a new data viz that told a specific story that was not clear in the original visualization. Click [here](/dataviz2.md) to take a look at the assignment.

## Youtuber Athletes
This was the first assignment where I had to get user feedback, which is a crucial part of telling a story through visualizations. A took an article from the Sports Business Journal and created a dataviz that I believe better suited the story the article wanted to show. Click [here](/dataviz3.md) to walk through my process.

# Final Project
For my final project a decided to take a look at popularity in sports. You can find my process [here](/final_project_clara.md).
