# Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon

# About me 
I am a student of the Entertainment Industry Management Masters (MEIM) at Heinz. I am from Argentina and moved to Pittsburgh in August. As my program suggests, I am interested in working in the entertainment industry, especifically in the business side of sport networks. 

# What I hope to learn
As someone with a bachellors degree in communications, I understand the importance of it and how it can shape the way we see the world and live our daily lives. Data visualization is a key part of that. In this course I look forward to learn new tools to create visualizations and gain knowledge on how to use these tools and dataviz theory to convey a story.

# My Class Portfolio
I will be posting my data visualizations throughout the class here and tracking my progress.
