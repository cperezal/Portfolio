## Wireframes - First Draft
Here is the first draft of my wireframes. I decided to do them by hand so I would have for me freedom with my ideas and wouldn't be constrained to my limited knowledge on software. Although the shorthand page will be a scroll, I did the wireframe in a horizontal matter, for the purpose of maximizing the space on the page.

## User Feedback Protocol
The audience of this presentation is people that have some knowledge of sports in general, but aren't sport fanatics. I want people to understand certain trends regarding popularity in sports and come out of the presentation with new insights of what makes athletes popular and new athletes they could potentially get to know if interested. When looking for individuals to interview, I looked for two people with a very limited knowledge of sports, and two people who had a broader knowledge of sports. I made this distinction because I wanted to understand if people with more knowledge of sports understood the story and the data vizualiations better. 

|     Question     | Main Findings |
|     ---------------     | ------------- |
| What do you think the main point is? | Most interviewees agreed that I was trying to find a relation between most popular athletes and most popular sports. However, all of them were misguided about why I included the olympics in the last slide. One of them thought that I was trying to show that the top 100 popular athletes went to the olympics. |
| What's the difference between the dot plot and the bar graph? | I was worried that the difference between these two charts wouldn't be clear, and it wasn't. Only one of them understood that the bar chart shows the most popular sports in order and then adds the popular athletes information. One of the interviewees was simply more drawn to the dot plot because of the colors. Digging in deeper, I understood that the confussion came from the graph showing the most popular sports. The circle plot with different sizes included the variable of "followers" for size, but the interviewees got confused. They simply needed to see a list of the most popular sports, so they could get the background information to understand the bar chart. |
| Is there anything you find confusing? | Only one interviewee understood why I included "pay" in the presentation. One of them initially thought I was trying to get the audience to pay for something. They were also all "caught off guard" with the mention of the olympics. |
| What are my final conclusions? | Although most didn't understand the call to action or the point I was trying to make by mentioning "pay", they all understood that some sports were under-represented in the top popular athletes list. |
| Other remarks | One of the interviewees suggested that he wasn't sure if low popularity was a consequence of low pay or if it was the other way around. I found this very insightful. |

## Revised Wireframes
Below are the revised wireframes. The first thing I changed is the dot plot for a pictorial. I think the representation of athletes with an icon of a person is much easier to understand than dots. Also, it is easy to see the relationship about which sports are the most popular. Likewise, creating an "other sports" group helps to reduce color clutter. The option of hovering over the icons and get the exact number of athletes is also a positive change, as it allows the audience to not only get a broad picture of what athletes play, but also be able to dig in deeper if they are interested.

Then, I replaced the bubble chart showing the top 10 most popular sports with a list, proving to be much more clear and easy to understand not only which are the top sports but also the following bar graph. Adding the numbers at the end of the bars instead of having a y-axis also makes the chart clearer. One of the most important things I incorporated is the explanation of the pay hypothesis. I took my interviewees observation about what comes first, pay or popularity, and visualzied that into a cycle, showing that although that is my hypothesis, it is hard to know what comes first. Lastly, I mentioned the olympics but simply as an "excuse" to get to know athletes, not as the main story.

Here are my revised wireframes:
