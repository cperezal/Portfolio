# Part 2

## Wireframes - First Draft
Here is the first draft of my wireframes. I decided to do them by hand so I would have for me freedom with my ideas and wouldn't be constrained to my limited knowledge on software. Although the shorthand page will be a scroll, I did the wireframe in a horizontal matter, for the purpose of maximizing the space on the page.

## User Feedback Protocol
The audience of this presentation is people that have some knowledge of sports in general, but aren't sport fanatics. I want people to understand certain trends regarding popularity in sports and come out of the presentation with new insights of what makes athletes popular and new athletes they could potentially get to know if interested. When looking for individuals to interview, I looked for two people with a very limited knowledge of sports, and two people who had a broader knowledge of sports. I made this distinction because I wanted to understand if people with more knowledge of sports understood the story and the data vizualiations better.
