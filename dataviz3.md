# Combat Sports Dataviz
## Original Visualization
Click [here](https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2020/01/27/Opinion/Bidarian.aspx) to see the dataviz that I will be redesigning.
I chose this visualization because I was amazed at how simplified it was. Although all the information is there and it is clearly understandable, it takes too much time for the audience to compare the numbers. Therefore, I do not think this dataviz is effective. The information itself is pretty easy to understand, so I think that a more visual dataviz, maybe with a scale, will be more effective to compare numbers.
