# Combat Sports Dataviz
This assignment was based on an [article](https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2020/01/27/Opinion/Bidarian.aspx) by Sports Business Journal. The article discusses how youtube starts are turning into athletes and how the present a gresat potential to find new audiences for combat sports. However, I believe that the visualizations used in the article are not the most effective when conveying this idea.

## Original Visualization
Click [here](https://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2020/01/27/Opinion/Bidarian.aspx) to see the dataviz that I will be redesigning.
I chose this visualization because I was amazed at how simplified it was. Although all the information is there and it is clearly understandable, it takes too much time for the audience to compare the numbers. Therefore, I do not think this dataviz is effective. The information itself is pretty easy to understand, so I think that a more elaborate dataviz, maybe with a scale, will be more effective to compare numbers.

## Wireframes
When I was brainstorming about how to make this dataviz clearer, I immediately thought that plotting the dots on a single axes might be a good way to compare the data. It took me a while to decide whether a horizontal or vertical axis would be better. I decided on a vertical axis, since I find it more intuitive: the higher up the axis, the more followers. After deciding on one axis, I created a dot plot. There were three categories of combat athletes, which I originally intended to keep. I Also added a more explanatory title to make it clear what the data represented. I also struggled deciding on what data to plot, since the original data set had many different categories regarding followers in different platforms. I decided that the number of total followers is the most important category for the story I want to tell. I want to show that youtubers present a valuable new audience base, and there was no need to divide audience per platform to show this.
Here is the first wirefram.

## Feedback
The feedback for this visualization was very constructive. Originally, the people I showed this to were confused about the title. When I explained it to them it made sense, but their first impressions were off, leading me to change the wording. The main critique I got was about the color. People weren't interested in each single category, they simply wanted to compare traditional combat stars vs influencers. I also asked if it would be valuable for them to know the names of each star, and they concluded that its the amount of followers that are important, not who the influencers are.
Here is a new wireframe made after the feedback.

## Final Dataviz
I decided to do the final visualization using Tableau. The only difference is that I decided to include the names of each athlete, but only when hovering over. This way, if the audience wants more information they can have it, and if not it doesn't create visual clutter. As I am a new Tableau user, I ran into issues with formating and couldn't, at the time of this post, find a solution for the cluttered title.
