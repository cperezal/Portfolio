# Outline
## Project Summary
In this project, I look forward to analyzing how the most popular athletes and the most popular sports are related. As someone who aspires to work in the sports industry, this project will help me understand fan habits and spot potential untapped layers of the market. I want my audience to get a broad picture of sports popularity world wide.

## Project Structure
My project will be structured in the following way, with the following story arc.

1. Setup: Each year ESPN realeases a World Fame 100 list that shows the most popular athletes in the world. 
2. How do we determine popularity though? *Explain ESPN's method*
3. Dataviz: *Show Top 100 list*
4. "Conflict": However, is this a clear representation of the popularity of a sport? 
5. Dataviz: *Which sport has the most popular athletes?*
6. Dataviz: *What are the most popular sports?*
7. Resolution: It depends how we look at it. Overall, it is true for the top three sports, but after that many sports do not have athlete representation in the top 100 list. 
8. Dataviz: *Show, per sport, how many athletes appear on the list*
9. Does the popularity of its players make the sport more popular? Not necessarily. 
10. Takeaway: Working in the sports industry, I think it is important to understand fan behaviour, to know how to communicate with fans from different sports.
