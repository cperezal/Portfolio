# Outline
## Project Summary
In this project, I look forward to analyzing how the most popular athletes and the most popular sports are related. As someone who aspires to work in the sports industry, this project will help me understand fan habits and spot potential untapped layers of the market. I want my audience to get a broad picture of sports popularity world wide.

## Project Structure
My project will be structured in the following way, with the following story arc.

1. Setup: Each year ESPN realeases a World Fame 100 list that shows the most popular athletes in the world. 
2. How do we determine popularity though? *Explain ESPN's method*
3. Dataviz: *Show Top 100 list*
4. "Conflict": However, is this a clear representation of the popularity of a sport? 
5. Dataviz: *Which sport has the most popular athletes?*
6. Dataviz: *What are the most popular sports?*
7. Resolution: It depends how we look at it. Overall, it is true for the top three sports, but after that many sports do not have athlete representation in the top 100 list. 
8. Dataviz: *Show, per sport, how many athletes appear on the list*
9. Does the popularity of its players make the sport more popular? Not necessarily. 
10. Takeaway: Working in the sports industry, I think it is important to understand fan behaviour, to know how to communicate with fans from different sports.

## Data Sources
For this project, I will use two separate sources of data. First, I will focus on [ESPN's World Fame 100](/http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/26113613/espn-world-fame-100-2019). Every year ESPN prepares a list of the 100 most popular athletes. In order to create this ranking, ESPN uses three different variables: search score, endorsements, and social media followers. However, for this project, I will only use the ranked position for each athlete, the sport they play, and their nationality. This data is publicly available online.

The second source that I will use is the [Top 10 Most Popular Sports in the World](/https://sportsshow.net/top-10-most-popular-sports-in-the-world/) ranking from Sports Show. In order to create this ranking, Sports Show used 15 different criteria, including global fan base, viewership, and tv rights deal, to identify which sports have the greatest number of followers. This source also includes information about the regions where each sport is more popular. For this project, I will only focus on the first 10 sports on the ranking, the number of followers. This data is also publically available online.

## Method and Medium
Finally, the project will be presented using Shorthand. A Shorthand page will be created for the whole project and the same one will be used for the 60 second-presentation. This page will be divided in three sections (as shown on the sketches) and the audience will be able to scroll down the entire page. Therefore, the story will be told in a linear fashion. The use of color has not yet been determined, but the same color theme will be used throughout the presentation. Shorthand will provide a simple way for the audience to engage with the data and follow the story. Although the story will be told using texts and data visualizations, some graphs will be interactive and allow the audience to explore other categories that might not be the central theme of the presentation. For example, as shown in the first sketch, it will be possible to filter athletes by gender, although gender is not the central theme.
