# POPULARITY IN SPORTS - FINAL PROJECT
I took a look at popularity in sports and analyzed how the popularity of a sport and the popularity of its athletes relate. You can view my project [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/is-there-a-relation-between-the-most-popular-athletes-and-the-most-popular-sports-/index.html) or go through my process below. 

# Part I: Outline

## Project Summary
In this project, I look forward to analyzing how the most popular athletes and the most popular sports are related. As someone who aspires to work in the sports industry, this project will help me understand fan habits and spot potential untapped layers of the market. I want my audience to get a broad picture of sports popularity world wide.

## Project Structure
My project will be structured in the following way, with the following story arc.

1. Setup: Each year ESPN realeases a World Fame 100 list that shows the most popular athletes in the world. 
2. How do we determine popularity though? *Explain ESPN's method*
3. Dataviz: *Show Top 100 list*
4. "Conflict": However, is this a clear representation of the popularity of a sport? 
5. Dataviz: *Which sport has the most popular athletes?*
6. Dataviz: *What are the most popular sports?*
7. Resolution: It depends how we look at it. Overall, it is true for the top three sports, but after that many sports do not have athlete representation in the top 100 list. 
8. Dataviz: *Show, per sport, how many athletes appear on the list*
9. Does the popularity of its players make the sport more popular? Not necessarily. 
10. Takeaway: Working in the sports industry, I think it is important to understand fan behaviour, to know how to communicate with fans from different sports.

## Data Sources
For this project, I will use two separate sources of data. First, I will focus on [ESPN's World Fame 100](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/26113613/espn-world-fame-100-2019). Every year ESPN prepares a list of the 100 most popular athletes. In order to create this ranking, ESPN uses three different variables: search score, endorsements, and social media followers. However, for this project, I will only use the ranked position for each athlete, the sport they play, and their nationality. This data is publicly available online.

Sachin D. Chandan, Charlotte Gibson, Fernando Olivieri, ESPN Stats and Information. (2019). 2019 World Fame 100. Retrieved from [http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/26113613/espn-world-fame-100-2019](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/26113613/espn-world-fame-100-2019)

The second source that I will use is the [Top 10 Most Popular Sports in the World](https://sportsshow.net/top-10-most-popular-sports-in-the-world/) ranking from Sports Show. In order to create this ranking, Sports Show used 15 different criteria, including global fan base, viewership, and tv rights deal, to identify which sports have the greatest number of followers. This source also includes information about the regions where each sport is more popular. For this project, I will only focus on the first 10 sports on the ranking, the number of followers. This data is also publically available online.

The last source that will be used is Forbes' list of [Highest-Paid Athletes](https://www.forbes.com/athletes/list/#tab:overall). In order to organize this ranking, Forbes takes into account an athletes's salaries and their endorsements. I will use this data base to explore if there is a relationship between an athlete's pay and their popularity.

## Method and Medium
Finally, the project will be presented using Shorthand. A Shorthand page will be created for the whole project and the same one will be used for the 60 second-presentation. This page will be divided in three sections (as shown on the sketches) and the audience will be able to scroll down the entire page. Therefore, the story will be told in a linear fashion. The use of color has not yet been determined, but the same color theme will be used throughout the presentation. Shorthand will provide a simple way for the audience to engage with the data and follow the story. Although the story will be told using texts and data visualizations, some graphs will be interactive and allow the audience to explore other categories that might not be the central theme of the presentation. For example, as shown in the first sketch, it will be possible to filter athletes by gender, although gender is not the central theme.

# Part II: Wireframes and User Research


## Wireframes - First Draft
Here is the first draft of my wireframes. I decided to do them by hand so I would have for me freedom with my ideas and wouldn't be constrained to my limited knowledge on software. Although the shorthand page will be a scroll, I did the wireframe in a horizontal matter, for the purpose of maximizing the space on the page.

## User Feedback Protocol
The audience of this presentation is people that have some knowledge of sports in general, but aren't sport fanatics. I want people to understand certain trends regarding popularity in sports and come out of the presentation with new insights of what makes athletes popular and new athletes they could potentially get to know if interested. When looking for individuals to interview, I looked for two people with a very limited knowledge of sports, and two people who had a broader knowledge of sports. I made this distinction because I wanted to understand if people with more knowledge of sports understood the story and the data vizualiations better. 

|     Question     | Main Findings |
|     ---------------     | ------------- |
| What do you think the main point is? | Most interviewees agreed that I was trying to find a relation between most popular athletes and most popular sports. However, all of them were misguided about why I included the olympics in the last slide. One of them thought that I was trying to show that the top 100 popular athletes went to the olympics. |
| What's the difference between the dot plot and the bar graph? | I was worried that the difference between these two charts wouldn't be clear, and it wasn't. Only one of them understood that the bar chart shows the most popular sports in order and then adds the popular athletes information. One of the interviewees was simply more drawn to the dot plot because of the colors. Digging in deeper, I understood that the confussion came from the graph showing the most popular sports. The circle plot with different sizes included the variable of "followers" for size, but the interviewees got confused. They simply needed to see a list of the most popular sports, so they could get the background information to understand the bar chart. |
| Is there anything you find confusing? | Only one interviewee understood why I included "pay" in the presentation. One of them initially thought I was trying to get the audience to pay for something. They were also all "caught off guard" with the mention of the olympics. |
| What are my final conclusions? | Although most didn't understand the call to action or the point I was trying to make by mentioning "pay", they all understood that some sports were under-represented in the top popular athletes list. |
| Other remarks | One of the interviewees suggested that he wasn't sure if low popularity was a consequence of low pay or if it was the other way around. I found this very insightful. |

## Revised Wireframes
Below are the revised wireframes. The first thing I changed is the dot plot for a pictorial. I think the representation of athletes with an icon of a person is much easier to understand than dots. Also, it is easy to see the relationship about which sports are the most popular. Likewise, creating an "other sports" group helps to reduce color clutter. The option of hovering over the icons and get the exact number of athletes is also a positive change, as it allows the audience to not only get a broad picture of what athletes play, but also be able to dig in deeper if they are interested.

Then, I replaced the bubble chart showing the top 10 most popular sports with a list, proving to be much more clear and easy to understand not only which are the top sports but also the following bar graph. Adding the numbers at the end of the bars instead of having a y-axis also makes the chart clearer. One of the most important things I incorporated is the explanation of the pay hypothesis. I took my interviewees observation about what comes first, pay or popularity, and visualzied that into a cycle, showing that although that is my hypothesis, it is hard to know what comes first. Lastly, I mentioned the olympics but simply as an "excuse" to get to know athletes, not as the main story.

Here are my revised wireframes:

# Part III: Final Deliverable

## Defining my audience
When deciding my topic, I was aiming at chosing a subject that will be relevant to my professional development. As I am interested in working in the sports industry, and possibly in an agency, I believe that understanding trends in popularity will allow me to get a better understanding of the relationship between athletes and their fans. However, it was hard for me to find a focus that could possibly attract other audiences. Therefore, in the user feedback stage, I chose subjects that weren't as interested in sports as I am. I found that they were still interested in the popularity aspect of the story and understanding how popularity can or not relate to an athlete's sport. 

When tailoring my presentation, I decided to put more focus in the popularity aspect and what could lead to this popularity. In order to do this, I gave more emphasis to the pay element of the story. This way, I was able to change my audience focus in order to appeal to people that are interested in pop culture in general.

## Design decisions
Given that I had a lot of infographics in my project, the first obstacle I encountered was deciding whether I should use the same format for all of them. I found that no template or specific software fit my needs, so I designed my own infographics and used both [Canva](www.canva.com) and [Infogram](www.infogram.com). In order to give the visuals some continuity, I used similar color schemes for all the infographics. 

In order to show which sports the athletes in the top 100 play, I decided to use a pictorial because I liked the idea of one person representing one athlete. However, I ecountered certain limitations in the Infogram platform and was not able to plot 100 icons. Therefore, I chose to show porportions, which still clearly shwos that soccer, basketball, and cricket are most represented in the most popular athletes list. However, by mousing over the graph, the exact numbers are shown. I grouped sports that have less than 3 athletes on the list as "others" because there were over 10 sports in the list, and showing all of them sepparately was going to generate visual clutter.

One of the most important visualizations for the story is the one that shows how many athlete's in the top 100 play the 10 most popular sports. I struggled trying to figure out the best way to visualize this. I wanted to show that some sports had zero players in the top 100. However, I found that it is very difficult to show nullness. Originally, I tried a size chart, then a bar graph (as shown in my wireframes). As I developed the project, I continued to ask for user feedback, and this graph was causing a lot of confusion. I then tried to create a double bar graph, showing the followers for each sport together with the amount of athletes in the top 100. However, the ranges of numbers were so different that I would have had to include two axes, adding visual clutter and making it even more difficult to understand. 

My final option, which was the most simple and the most effective was to create an infographic. Upon reflection, I think I had not thought of an infographic as an option because I was trying to make my presentation more "sofisticated" in regards to my data visualizations. However, as we have discussed in class, many times the simplest ideas are the ones that get the point accross and they should not be discredited for their simplicity.
